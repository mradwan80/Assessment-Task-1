# Assessment-Task-1

This repo contains a solution to a simple task I was asked to do for an interview in 2018.


The task:

-setup a server (using restbed library) that returns a json containing an array of 3D objects and their positions, as a response for any request.

-The positions of the objects are linearly interpolated between two 3D points. The coordinates of the two points and the number of objects are defined in a config file.

-dockerize the solution

-add unit tests (using googletest)
