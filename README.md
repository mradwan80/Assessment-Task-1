# Assessment-Task-1
This repo contains a solution to a task I asked to finish for an interview in 2018.

The task:
-setup a server that returns a json containing an array of 3D objects and their positions
-The positions of the objects are linearly interpolated between two 3D points. The coordinates of the two points and the number of objects are defined in a config file.
-dockerize the solution
-add unit tests
